Cookstagram is a simplified social media application focused on the creation and posting of recipes.  Users have delete functionality available through their own authenticated profile.  Recipe cards include a collapsible display to get greater view economy out of the main feed and profile pages.

Note:  App is deployed on Render.io which may take greater time to load based on last use.
