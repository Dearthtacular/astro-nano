Python | Django | PostgreSQL | Bootstrap | AWS

Ruckus is a social media app with wide functionality that includes common social media features such as likes and follows.
This was a group project, and my core responsibility was UI/UX.  I built on the experience I obtained during the creation
of <a class="times" href="/projects/project-2">Mileage Tracker</a> to modify Bootstrap into a user experience with greater visual appeal.

Note:  App is deployed on Render.io which may take greater time to load based on last use.
