I hadn't planned on working in a war zone, but the 2008 recession was not kind to me.  I was hired for my initial role of Operations Data Analyst having not met the base requirements for the position.  On paper, I was a liability.  My recuiter took the gamble and within two weeks I was on a plane to Afghanistan.  Once there, I learned base operations and quickly earned the respect of my site managers.  I was cycled through three sites (this is a good thing) prior to getting promoted to Operations Project Lead and transferred to the Reductions and Initiatives team in 2014 during the drawdown.  It was at this time I obtained my PMP and began my online MBA program with the University of Texas at Dallas.
